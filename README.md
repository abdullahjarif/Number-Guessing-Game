# Number-Guessing-Game

✅ Implement this number guessing game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
➡️ This game rule is: 

  ▫️**Player-01** give a number. 
  
  ▫️The number must be between 1 and 10. Not any character or string. 
  
  ▫️Then, **Player-02** must guess the number that **Player-01** gives, within five attempts. 
  
  ▫️If **player-02** doesn't guess the number at this time, **player-01** wins this game; otherwise, **player-02** wins this game.
